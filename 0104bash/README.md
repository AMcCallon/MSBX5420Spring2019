There is no formal homework to hand in this week.  Your "only" task is to learn.

Please watch the following 3 videos (in order):

Make sure that you follow along in your own VM.  Pause the video often and try out the commands yourself.

Once you have watched, you can reinforce what you have learned by working through this tutorial (if you want):

However, as discussed in the videos, please skip the section on `vi` (pronounced "vee eye").  We are using
`nano`.
