# Exam 1 instructions

You will need to submit a single notebook into Canvas (note:  I want the notebook itself, NOT the HTML version).
You can download it using this command:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sstirlin/MSBX5420Spring2019/master/0502examweblogs/exam1.ipynb
```

## Errata

### Problems 2-5

Please ONLY use `good_rdd` to make your estimates for these problems.  You shouldn't need any of
the other RDDs that we worked with in Problem 1.

### Problem 3

I accidentally forgot to tell you the name of the variable to store you estimate.  Use `unsuccessful_ratio`
