# Homework for week 3

In this week's homework you will be required to submit 3 files to Canvas:  `stock_kurtosis.ipynb`,
`ImperativeStats.ipynb`, and `FunctionalStats.ipynb`.  You will also see a notebook called `FunctionalStats-RDDs.ipynb`,
but that is for next week.  Please ignore it for now.

These files will be auto-graded by computer, so you must be careful to submit *exactly* as described.


## Autograder (stock kurtosis)

The first is a real-world example of kurtosis (4th moment) in stock returns.
The *real* objective of this exercise is to become accustomed to writing code that can be graded automatically,
but the example is fun and instructive as well.

Instructions can be found here:

## Imperative stats

In this exercise you will compute the first several statistical moments of some distributions.  You
will do this in an *imperative* style (think:  `for` loops).  Instructions can be found here:

## Functional stats

In this exercise you will repeat the computation of statistical moments, but instead using a *functional*
style of programming (think `map`, `filter`, `reduce`).  The instructions can be found in the same place:

## Videos

I will post extended "Office Hours videos" here later today where I answer the common questions that I am
hearing, and point out a few extra things.  COMING SOON.
